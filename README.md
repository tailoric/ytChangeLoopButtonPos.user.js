# ytChangeLoopButtonPos.user.js
Userscript for changing the position of the loop button to where it used to be (third entry in the right click menu)

This is mostly created for my own convinience because the loop button position change resulted in me missclicking the copy url button instead of clicking copy url at this time button.

to install just click the following link:
